You can use the flags -csv=pathtocsv to specify your own csv file and -limit=integer adds a timer to your game

You can simply clone and use go to run the project with go run main.go or go build main.go && ./main.exe
Add the flags mentioned above to handle your own csv or time limit otherwise they default to the included csv and 30 for the time limit. 
You can also use go run main.go -h to find more info on the flags or go build main.go && ./main.exe -h
